  <h1>The Jail Adventure Book - By Cameron (written 2017)</h1>
<p>
You wake up at 6am when your alarm goes off.  You think you are waking up in your bedroom but.... 
  You find yourself in a jail instead.  
</p>
<p>
You look around.  There is nothing in the cell except a toilet and a sink.  The door is locked.  
  All of a sudden.  The door opens and in comes a guard with a name tage that says "Mr Sir."
</p>
<p>
 MR. SIR:  Backaway from the door meatbag.  I have a new cellmate for you.  
  Hopefully you two meatbags will get along.  Ha, ha, ha.  
</p>
<p>
  He steps out and locks the door.  Your new cellmate is a pig.  The pig turns to you and introduces himself.
  <br><br>
  PIG:  I am pig.  Nice to meet you.  Do you want to escape with me?
