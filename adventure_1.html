  PIG: Thank you for trusting me. I have a plan. 
  <br><br>
   PIG: My plan is to use this stick of dynamite to blow a hole in the wall. Then we can escape together.
    <br><br>
    As the pig is talking you find a key under your matress. Pig should see this you think.
     <br><br>  
   YOU: Pig look what I found. It's a key.  It might open the door.
    <br><br>
    PIG: I don't think this is the right key
    <br><br>
   YOU: Hmmmmmm. What if pig is right and the key is not the right key. Then you will be traped in here forever.  
    But if it's the right key you can escape.
