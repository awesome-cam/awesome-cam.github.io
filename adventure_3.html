  The pig expertly lights up the dynamite and blows open the metal door to the jail cell.  You are now free!  
    Together, you and pig run out the door and down a dull, dark hallway.  It looks like these halls have not been used in a long time. 
    The hallway is very warm.
  <br><br>
   PIG: Wow.  It's hot in this place!  I'm bacon.
    <br><br>
    Oh great.  A pig with a sense of humour you think to yourself.  You turn a corner and find an old service elevator.  
    The doors open and a large group of guards.  They are not just ordinary guards.  They are cow guards!
     <br><br>  
   YOU: Run Pig.  Run!!!!
    <br><br>
   You and pig start running in the opposite direction.  After a few minutes you notice that pig is way behind you.
