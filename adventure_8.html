  <h1>Adventure Page 8</h1>
  <p>
  You decide to trust pigs instincs keep on running down the hall. As you are running down the hall you notice another door.
  <br><br>
  YOU: What pig! I see another door!
    As you slow down to take a closer look you notice it looks like the door from your cell.
    <br><br>
   Before you have time to think you see more cow guards. 
     <br><br>  
   PIG: Oh no! Quick inside the door he yells.
    <br><br>
    Inside you see a chair and a belt of grenades. Above the chair in the cell is an air vent.  
    <br><br>
    PIG: Those grenades look dangerous.  I don't think we should use them.
