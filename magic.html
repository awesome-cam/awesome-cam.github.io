  <h1>My Hummingbird Set in action</h1>
<p>
I first used a Hummingbird set during one of my Surrey Challenge programs last year.  I enjoyed being able to program things that move!  
My sister made this diorama for school and she let me make it come alive with motion sensors, lights and gears.  
  I used the Hummingbird kit components and Scratch to hook it up to her ipad so she could turn it off and on.
