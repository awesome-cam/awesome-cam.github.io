   The moral of this story is that you should always trust the pig.
    <br><br>
You open the door and to your suprise the door swings open before you even touch it! At first glance the room looks empty but after your eyes adjust to the darkness you notice something moving in the corner.
  Ahhhhhhh you scream! The something in the corner is getting closer. Ahhhhhh you scream again as you see what it is.
    <br><br>
    Its an ugly veggie monster! You notice more of them. They're getting closer. One is bitting your leg and right then you know it is 
  THE END!
