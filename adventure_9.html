  <h1>Adventure Page 9</h1>
  <p>
  You think to yourself that you are glad you went back to save pig.  He seems like a really nice pig, 
not that you have met many talking pigs before.
  <br><br>
   After a few minutes of running down the hall you notice a door.  
    The door was golden and hurt your eyes to look at because it reflected all the light.
    <br><br>
   PIG:  Wait.  It could be a trap!
     <br><br>  
   YOU: But we need to get away from the cow guards.  It could be a way out!
