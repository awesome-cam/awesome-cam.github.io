  <h1>My Hummingbird Set in action: operating my little sister's ocean diorama project</h1>
<p>
My sister made this diorama for school.  She let me make it come alive with motion sensors, lights and gears.  I used Scratch to hook it up to her ipad so she could turn it off and on.  My sister and I often use the humming bird set together.  She builds things and I program them and make them move.
