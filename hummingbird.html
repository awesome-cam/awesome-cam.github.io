  <h1>My Hummingbird Set in action: operating my little sister's ocean diorama project</h1>
<p>
I first used a Hummingbird set during one of my Surrey Challenge programs last year.  I saved up my allowance and bought my own kit.  
My sister made this diorama for school and she let me make it come alive with motion sensors, lights and gears.  
  I used the Hummingbird kit components and Scratch to hook it up to her ipad so she could turn it off and on.  
  My sister and I often use the hummingbird set together.  She builds things and I program them and make them move.
