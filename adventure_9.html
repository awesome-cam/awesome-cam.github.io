  You agree with pig that the grenades look dangerous.  Instead you decide to climb up the air vent.
  <br><br>
   After a few minutes crawling through the air vent you find a small door.  
    You climb through it and find yourself in a great open green grass field.  Safe from the jail.
  <br><br>
   PIG: You did it!
   <br><br>
   YOU:  No pig.  We did it.  Together!  I am so glad I trusted the pig.
   <br><br>
